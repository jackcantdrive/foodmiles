## FoodMiles

FoodMiles provides small direct financial incentives to users when they choose restaurant meals made with ingredients sourced more locally. FoodMiles achieves this by providing an easy to use augumented reality overlay on existing resturant menus via your phone, which shows the estimated total distance travelled by the ingredients for each item.
